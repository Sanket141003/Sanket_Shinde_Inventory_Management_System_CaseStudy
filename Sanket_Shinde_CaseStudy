Inventory Management System for B2B SaaS
Overview
You're joining a team building "StockFlow" - a B2B inventory management platform. Small businesses use it to track products across multiple warehouses and manage supplier relationships.
Time Allocation
Take-Home Portion: 90 minutes maximum
Live Discussion: 30-45 minutes (scheduled separately)

Part 1: Code Review & Debugging (30 minutes)
A previous intern wrote this API endpoint for adding new products. Something is wrong - the code compiles but doesn't work as expected in production.
@app.route('/api/products', methods=['POST'])
def create_product():
    data = request.json
    
    # Create new product
    product = Product(
        name=data['name'],
        sku=data['sku'],
        price=data['price'],
        warehouse_id=data['warehouse_id']
    )
    
    db.session.add(product)
    db.session.commit()
    
    # Update inventory count
    inventory = Inventory(
        product_id=product.id,
        warehouse_id=data['warehouse_id'],
        quantity=data['initial_quantity']
    )
    
    db.session.add(inventory)
    db.session.commit()
    
    return {"message": "Product created", "product_id": product.id}

Your Tasks:
Identify Issues: List all problems you see with this code (technical and business logic)
Explain Impact: For each issue, explain what could go wrong in production
Provide Fixes: Write the corrected version with explanations
Additional Context (you may need to ask for more):
Products can exist in multiple warehouses
SKUs must be unique across the platform
Price can be decimal values
Some fields might be optional

Part 2: Database Design (25 minutes)
Based on the requirements below, design a database schema. Note: These requirements are intentionally incomplete - you should identify what's missing.
Given Requirements:
Companies can have multiple warehouses
Products can be stored in multiple warehouses with different quantities
Track when inventory levels change
Suppliers provide products to companies
Some products might be "bundles" containing other products
Your Tasks:
Design Schema: Create tables with columns, data types, and relationships
Identify Gaps: List questions you'd ask the product team about missing requirements
Explain Decisions: Justify your design choices (indexes, constraints, etc.)
Format: Use any notation (SQL DDL, ERD, text description, etc.)

Part 3: API Implementation (35 minutes)
Implement an endpoint that returns low-stock alerts for a company.
Business Rules (discovered through previous questions):
Low stock threshold varies by product type
Only alert for products with recent sales activity
Must handle multiple warehouses per company
Include supplier information for reordering
Endpoint Specification:
GET /api/companies/{company_id}/alerts/low-stock

Expected Response Format:
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "product_id": 123,
      "product_name": "Widget A",
      "sku": "WID-001",
      "warehouse_id": 456,
      "warehouse_name": "Main Warehouse",
      "current_stock": 5,
      "threshold": 20,
      "days_until_stockout": 12,
      "supplier": {
        "id": 789,
        "name": "Supplier Corp",
        "contact_email": "orders@supplier.com"
      }
    }
  ],
  "total_alerts": 1
}

Your Tasks:
Write Implementation: Use any language/framework (Python/Flask, Node.js/Express, etc.)
Handle Edge Cases: Consider what could go wrong
Explain Approach: Add comments explaining your logic
Hints: You'll need to make assumptions about the database schema and business logic. Document these assumptions.

Submission Instructions
Create a document with your responses to all three parts
Include reasoning for each decision you made
List assumptions you had to make due to incomplete requirements
Submit within 90 minutes of receiving this case study
Be prepared to walk through your solutions in the live session

Live Session Topics (Preview)
During our video call, we'll discuss:
Your debugging approach and thought process
Database design trade-offs and scalability considerations
How you'd handle edge cases in your API implementation
Questions about missing requirements and how you'd gather more info
Alternative approaches you considered

Evaluation Criteria
Technical Skills:
Code quality and best practices
Database design principles
Understanding of API design
Problem-solving approach
Communication:
Ability to identify and ask about ambiguities
Clear explanation of technical decisions
Professional collaboration style
Business Understanding:
Recognition of real-world constraints
Consideration of user experience
Scalability and maintenance thinking

Note: This is designed to assess your current skill level and learning potential. We don't expect perfect solutions - we're more interested in your thought process and ability to work with incomplete information.
